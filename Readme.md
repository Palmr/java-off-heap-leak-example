# Java Off-Heap Memory Leak Example

This is a little example project that consumes memory in Java in several ways to help demonstrate investigating memory 
leaks in Java for a presentation I gave on that topic.

Definitely do not look at this code for good practices. There are intentional leaks throughout.

## Presentation

// TODO - Link to presentation

## Building

Build using `gradle assemble` which should generate an archive containing the distributable code in build/distributions

## Running

// TODO - Instructions for running this to get results as per the demo required in the presentation
